# Physics Animations

Some physics animations that I make for fun.

__heating_a_plate__

A gif showing the heating of a square plate.

_Instructions:_ Run the C code using the Makefile (you need to have gcc). Then, run the python code make_gif.py. Check that N, the number of files created by the C code, is correct. I still don't know how to do it automatically.

__invasion_percolation__

Image of a coffe stain, using the _invasion percolation_ algorithm.

_Instructions:_ Run the C code using the Makefile (you need to have gcc). Then, run the python code plot_frac.py to generate an image of a beatiful stain :D

__double_pendulum.py__

Animation of a double pendulum with random initial angles using pygame.

__wheel.py__

The trayectory of one point of a rolling wheel, in pygame.

__elpiter.py__

A code that I found on the Internet in which I learned pygame. I save it just for reference.

__planets.py__

Ignore it. It doesn't work yet.
